> ## Common Machine Learning Activation Functions

### 1. Sigmoid
python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Range: (0, 1)
# Use case: Binary classification output layer


### 2. Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)
python
def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

# Range: (-1, 1)
# Use case: Hidden layers, zero-centered output


### 3. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
python
def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

# Range: [0, ∞)
# Use case: Most popular for hidden layers


### 4. Leaky ReLU
python
def leaky_relu(x, alpha=0.01):
    return np.where(x > 0, x, alpha * x)

# Fixes "dying ReLU" problem


### 5. Softmax
python
def softmax(x):
    exp_x = np.exp(x - np.max(x))  # Numerical stability
    return exp_x / np.sum(exp_x, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

# Use case: Multi-class classification output


### 6. GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)
python
def gelu(x):
    return 0.5 * x * (1 + np.tanh(np.sqrt(2/np.pi) * (x + 0.044715 * x**3)))

# Use case: Modern transformers (GPT, BERT)


## How Activation Functions Work

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks:

python
# Without activation (linear transformation only)
output = W * input + b

# With activation function
output = activation_function(W * input + b)


### Mathematical Purpose:
1. Transform linear combinations into non-linear outputs
2. Control signal flow through the network
3. Enable gradient-based learning through backpropagation

## Why Activation Functions Are Needed

### 1. Non-linearity Requirement
python
# Linear network (no activation)
layer1 = W1 * x + b1
layer2 = W2 * layer1 + b2
# This is equivalent to: (W2 * W1) * x + (W2 * b1 + b2)
# Just a single linear transformation!

# Non-linear network (with activation)
layer1 = activation(W1 * x + b1)
layer2 = activation(W2 * layer1 + b2)
# Now we can learn complex patterns


### 2. Universal Approximation
Neural networks with non-linear activations can approximate any continuous function (Universal Approximation Theorem).

The Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT) states that a feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer containing a finite number of neurons can approximate any continuous function on a compact subset of real n-dimensional space (R^n) to any desired degree of accuracy, given a suitable activation function. Essentially, it means that neural networks, despite their seemingly simple structure, are powerful enough to represent a vast range of functions. 

The UAT is a cornerstone of neural network theory, highlighting their ability to learn complex patterns and relationships within data

Limitations:
While powerful, the UAT doesn't guarantee easy training or efficient computation. It doesn't specify how to find the optimal network architecture or the best way to train it according to Artificial Intelligence in Plain English. 

Overfitting:
A network with too many neurons might memorize the training data instead of generalizing well to new data according to Artificial Intelligence in Plain English. 

Computational Complexity:
Increasing the number of neurons improves approximation but also increases the computational cost of training. 
In essence, the UAT provides a theoretical guarantee that neural networks can approximate complex functions, but it's crucial to understand its limitations and the practical challenges involved in training and using them effectively. 

### 3. Feature Learning
Activation functions enable networks to learn hierarchical features:
• **Lower layers**: Simple patterns (edges, textures)
• **Higher layers**: Complex patterns (objects, concepts)

## What Happens Without Activation Functions

### Problem: Linear Collapse
python
# 3-layer network without activation
h1 = W1 @ x + b1
h2 = W2 @ h1 + b2  
output = W3 @ h2 + b3

# Mathematically equivalent to:
output = (W3 @ W2 @ W1) @ x + (W3 @ W2 @ b1 + W3 @ b2 + b3)
# = W_combined @ x + b_combined

# No matter how many layers, it's just linear regression!


### Consequences:
1. Cannot learn XOR function or any non-linearly separable data
2. No benefit from depth - multiple layers = single layer
3. Limited to linear decision boundaries
4. Cannot model complex relationships

## Activation Functions vs Loss Functions

### **Activation Functions**
• **Purpose**: Transform neuron outputs, introduce non-linearity
• **Location**: Applied to each neuron's output
• **Scope**: Local transformation within layers
• **Examples**: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh

python
# Applied during forward pass
hidden = relu(W @ input + b)
output = softmax(W2 @ hidden + b2)


### **Loss Functions**
• **Purpose**: Measure prediction error, guide learning
• **Location**: Applied to final network output vs true labels
• **Scope**: Global measure of network performance
• **Examples**: Cross-entropy, MSE, Huber loss

python
# Applied during training
predictions = model(input_data)
loss = cross_entropy(predictions, true_labels)


## Key Differences Table

| Aspect | Activation Functions | Loss Functions |
|--------|---------------------|----------------|
| When Used | Forward pass, every layer | Training, final output only |
| Purpose | Enable non-linearity | Measure prediction quality |
| Gradient | Local derivatives | Global optimization target |
| Count | Many per network | One per training step |
| Examples | ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh | CrossEntropy, MSE, MAE |

## Practical Example

python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.layer1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        self.layer2 = nn.Linear(128, 64)
        self.layer3 = nn.Linear(64, 10)
        
        # Activation functions (applied during forward pass)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.softmax = nn.Softmax(dim=1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.layer1(x))      # Activation function
        x = self.relu(self.layer2(x))      # Activation function
        x = self.softmax(self.layer3(x))   # Activation function
        return x

# Loss function (used during training)
model = SimpleNetwork()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()  # Loss function

# Training step
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = criterion(outputs, targets)  # Loss function calculates error


The activation functions enable the network to learn complex patterns, while the loss function guides the learning 
process by measuring how wrong the predictions are.
